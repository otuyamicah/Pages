<p>
An application programming interface (API) is a
computing interface to a software component or a system, that defines how other components or systems can use it. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.
An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or it can be designed based on an industry standard to ensure interoperability. 
Some APIs have to be documented, others are designed so that they can be "interrogated" to determine supported functionality. Since other components/systems rely only on the API, the system that provides the API can (ideally) change its internal details "behind" that API without affecting its users.
Today, with the rise of REST and web services over
HTTP, the term is often assumed to refer to APIs of such services when given no other context (see the Web APIs section).
Sometimes the term API is, by extension, used to refer to the subset of software entities (code, subcomponents, modules, etc.) that serve to actually implement the API of some encompassing component or system.

<h2>Purpose for API</h2>

<p>In building applications, an API (application programming interface) simplifies programming by abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs. While a graphical interface for an email client might provide a user with a button that performs all the steps for fetching and highlighting new emails, an API for file input/output might give the developer a
function that copies a file from one location to another without requiring that the developer understand the file system operations occurring behind the scenes.</p>
