<h1>What is a FRAMEWORK?</h1>

<p>In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable
software environment that provides particular functionality as part of a larger software platform to facilitate development of software applications, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (APIs) that bring together all the different
components to enable development of a project or system.</p>
<br />

<b>Frameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal libraries:
</b>


<ul>
<li><b><i>inversion of control:</b>In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's flow of control is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.</i></li>
<br/>
<li><b><i>extensibility:</b>A user can extend the framework – usually by selective overriding – or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.</i></li>
<br/>

<li><b><i>non-modifiable framework code:</b>The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.</i></li>
</ul>
<br />


<p>Software frameworks typically contain considerable housekeeping and utility code in order to help bootstrap user applications, but generally focus on specific problem domains, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Artistic drawing</li> 
<li>music composition</li>
<li>mechanical CAD
<li>Financial modeling applications</li>
<li>Earth system modeling applications</li>
<li>Decision support systems</li>
<li>Media playback and authoring</li>
</ul>
<br />

<b>Examples of framework are as follows:</b>

<ul type="square">
<li>Ajax framework</li>
<li>JavaScript framework</li>
<li>Web framework</li>
<li>Middleware Cactus Framework - High performance scientific computing.</li>
<li>Application framework - General GUI applications.</li>
<li>Enterprise Architecture framework</li>
<li>Oracle Application Development Framework</li>
</ul>
<br />


<h2>Framework Architecture....</h2>
According to Pree,software frameworks consist of
frozen spots and hot spots.
<p>Frozen spots define the overall architecture of a software system, that is to say its basic components and the relationships between them. These remain unchanged (frozen) in any instantiation of the application framework.</p> 
<p>Hot spots represent those parts where the programmers using the framework add their own code to add the functionality specific to their own project.</p>
<p>In an object-oriented environment, a framework consists of abstract and concrete classes .
Instantiation of such a framework consists of
composing and subclassing the existing classes.
When developing a concrete software system with a software framework, developers utilize the hot spots according to the specific needs and requirements of the system. Software frameworks rely on the
Hollywood Principle : <mark>"Don't call us, we'll call you."</mark>This means that the user-defined classes (for example, new subclasses) receive messages from the predefined framework classes. Developers usually handle this by implementing superclass
abstract methods.</p>
